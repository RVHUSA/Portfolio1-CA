About This Portfolio
This portfolio showcases a curated selection of the work I’ve completed during my two years in the Frontend Development programme. It is designed to demonstrate my skills, growth, and accomplishments as a frontend developer — not just by telling, but by showing examples of what I can do.

Through this portfolio, I aim to:
- Present evidence of my technical abilities in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API integration.
- Reflect on what I’ve learned and the areas I want to improve.
- Provide a clear picture of my development journey for potential employers or collaborators.

I’ve also written a short retrospective analysis that outlines: What went well, what I struggled with and what I would improve if I revisited the project today.
